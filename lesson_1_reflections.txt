-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
easy way

-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you want to get back to a version you care about.

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros I'm the one who are able to identify what I really changed and whether it is really needs to be commmited or not
cons maybe I forget !

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
fsh5an ya captain

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Very awesome to compare !

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 I have the power dude :D
